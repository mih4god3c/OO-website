                      In Early Renaissance, our algorithm managed to cluster the artworks into three main clusters. One
                      cluster is made out of painitngs of Madonna holding a child, second cluster is represented by
                      portraits and the third cluster consits of painitngs of Crucification. Portraits are painted from
                      the shoulders up, with subjects not facing straight to the observer. We can see that the subjects
                      are depicted with more anatomical realism versus the earlier art. Most of the motives
                      are connected to religion, which is also very standard for the period of Early renaissance.

                      Similar to the Early renaissance, the Northern renaissance artits were focused on painting religious motives. That is especially
                      seen in sitting/laying poses where the algorithm detected pictures of Madonna holding a child as the most accurate pose for this period.
                      Religious motives are also most common in standing poses, which are dominated with paintings of Adam and Eve. Portraits on the other hand
                      look very similar to the ones presented in Early renaissance.

                      Classification of High renaissance paintings, looks very similar to both other renaissance
                      periods. We can see that there are again the same three clusters as before. There is a slight
                      difference in portraits,
                      where we noticed that more subjects are faicing straight to the observer. High renaissance is a
                      period dominated with religious motives. There are still some differences between the High and the
                      Early renaissance. Human figures
                      are painted much more divine, and there is also more use of the linear perspective and shading.

                      For the period of Mannerism our algorith managed to cluster images into all three clusters. We can still notice the presence
                      of Religion. Between standing poses there are still a majority which depict the Crucification of Jesus. Portraits look 
                      similar to portraits from other periods. Laying poses are dominated with painings of a nude woman.

                      For the period of Baroque, our algorithm managed to cluster the painitngs into the next three
                      clusters. Poses where the subject is in laying position, portraits and painitngs containing
                      standing subjects. We can see less religious motives and more emphasis on the human body.
                      Paintings are also much more emphasizing beauty and majesty. In laying poses there are a lot of
                      paintings
                      representing a naked woman. We can also notice that portraits are drawn from further away. As for
                      the standing poses, we can see that our algorithm still classified the painitng of Crusification
                      as the best fit to the calculated median pose.

                      Paintings often depict themes of love, classical myths and playfulness. That is especially seen on vertical/standing poses.
                      Paintings contains many more subjects and they are in a lot of more movement compared to earlier periods. Even the laying  
                      poses have more than one subjects, there is also a motive of a nude woman, similar to what we have seen in Baroque.

                      The algorithm managed to cluster paintings from Romanticism into all three main clusters. We can notice
                      some main charasteristics of Romanticism in laying poses which are dynamic, emotional and restless. In standing poses
                      we can notice some individualism. The skeletons of portraits were too similar to portraits from other periods, so we could not
                      determine any specifics.

                      Artists in the period of Realism used their paintings to sarcastically depict political issues and problems. Others incorporated realism
                      by painting scenes of the working class, rural and urban life. Painigns include as much detail as possible. shadows, life reflecting, depth 
                      perception and perspecitve are all done with perfection. We can see that on the images that our algorithm chose, that the subjects in standing
                      poses really are representing the urban life. There is a lot more of movement and diverse poses. We can also notice that the algorithm did not find any 
                      horizontal poses, but it did manage to cluster together some portraits.

                      Post impressionism was a period where artists often included abstraction and used geometric shapes in unexpected ways. That is 
                      the main reason that the results look like they do. There was not many pictures with subjects in the database, so the algorithm
                      only managed to detect some portraits. Most of them are painted from the shoulders up, but there are some exceptions.

                      We can see the three main clusters that were found for the Art nouveau period. There was a
                      significant lack of images with laying poses, but the algorithm still managed to find a few.
                      Most portraits have the subject facing straight to the observer. As for the standing poses goes,
                      the skeletons are much less proportional than for example in some other periods.

                      For the period of Contemporary realism we noticed a specific in standing poses. There are many
                      painitngs with subjects standing close to eachother, which
                      made it hard for our algorithm to define poses because the skeletons were overleaping. Portraits
                      on the other hand look pretty standard. There was a lot of motives
                      of a laying woman which our algorithm defined as a cluster itself. These paintings were specific
                      for an American painter Eric Fischl.

                      As we can see, the algorithm managed to detect poses only in portraits. All other pictures were simply to abstract for our method to 
                      detect them, or they didn't even have any subjects, which is completely normal for the period of Pop art. Pop art utilized images and icons
                      from popular media and products. This included commercial items like cans, road signs, newspapers etc. It also included pictures of celebrities,
                      which we can clearly see in above collage. One problem, that lead to weak detections for this period was also that Pop art is characterized by bright colors,
                      which made it even harder for our algorithm to detect humans.
